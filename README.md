A cab booking website namely GoBooK.
Short description of the project:
GoBook is an online cab booking platform that provides users with a convenient way to book rides. It offers features like real-time cab tracking, fare estimation, and secure payment options, making transportation hassle-free and efficient.
What Problems Do You Face? - User Experience Design (UX): Crafting an intuitive, user-friendly interface is key for a smooth booking experience. Balancing a visually appealing design with functional aspects takes careful planning and testing.
How did you come up with the solution? --- I google searched the existing websites and tried to get the idea of designing.
List of all tools / libraries used: HTML, CSS, cdnjs
What did you learn from doing the project?---
1) Importance of User-Centered Design: I learned that designing with the user in mind is essential for success. Every feature had to be intuitive and accessible. Gathering feedback early on helped align the platform with user expectations, and addressing even small usability issues made a noticeable difference in user satisfaction.
2) Time Management and Prioritization: With multiple features to develop and deadlines to meet, I learned to prioritize tasks based on impact. Focusing on core functionalities before adding advanced features ensured that the platformâ€™s foundation was solid before expanding.
